# ask user for num and repeat until user got 7

# lists use [], not ()
numlist = ("7") # fix me

# you can just set 7 to be a variable, instead of a list.
# desired_number = 7

num = int(input("Please enter a number: "))

# while num is not equal to 7
# keep asking for user input

# while loop breaks once user input equals 7

# say well done for getting the right number
