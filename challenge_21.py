# Write a program that converts between centimetres, and inches
# you are mixing things in your assignments here
# 2.54 [space] cm is incorrect.  You should only assign a string or a number here.
# you want two vars:  cm_to_inches and inches_to_cm
inches = 2.54 cm
cm = 0.393700787 inches
# asking the user to input a number
num = int(input("Please enter a number: "))
# asking the user to choose between converting from centimetres to inches or from inches to centimetres

# you need another input from the user here

# calculating and outputting the result using functions

# what kind of logic would you use to determine what to do with the inputs?
